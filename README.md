# Max-Flow-Problem
Solving complex network flow problems such as the circulation problem using the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm

## Problem Specification:
Max Flow Problem

Maximum flow problems find a feasible flow through a single-source (S), single-sink (T) flow network that is maximum. This problem is useful for solving complex network flow problems such as the circulation problem.

Flow in the network has the following restrictions:
* Every link of the network has an individual capacity which is the maximum flow that the link
allows.
* Input flow must match to output flow for each node in the graph, except the source and 
sink node.
* Flow out from the source node must match with the flow into to sink node.
* Flow from each edge should not exceed the capacity of that node.
